# Data Model: Backend Todo API

## Task Entity

### Fields
- **id** (Integer, Primary Key, Auto-increment)
  - Unique identifier for each task
  - Auto-generated by the database

- **user_id** (UUID/String, Foreign Key)
  - References the user who owns this task
  - Required field, cannot be null
  - Enforces ownership and access control

- **title** (String, Variable Length, Max 255)
  - Required field, cannot be null
  - Descriptive title for the task

- **description** (Text, Optional)
  - Optional field, can be null
  - Detailed description of the task

- **completed** (Boolean)
  - Required field, defaults to False
  - Indicates whether the task is completed

- **created_at** (DateTime, Timestamp)
  - Required field, automatically set on creation
  - Records when the task was created

- **updated_at** (DateTime, Timestamp)
  - Required field, automatically updated on modification
  - Records when the task was last modified

### Relationships
- **Task** belongs to **User** (Many-to-One)
  - Each task is associated with one user
  - One user can have multiple tasks

### Constraints
- **Not Null Constraints**: id, user_id, title, completed, created_at, updated_at
- **Default Values**:
  - completed: False
  - created_at: Current timestamp
  - updated_at: Current timestamp
- **Length Constraints**:
  - title: Maximum 255 characters
- **Indexing**:
  - Index on user_id for efficient querying by user
  - Composite index on (user_id, created_at) for efficient retrieval of user tasks by date

### Validation Rules
- **Title**: Required, maximum 255 characters
- **Description**: Optional, no length limit
- **Completed**: Boolean value only (true/false)
- **User ID**: Must reference an existing user (when foreign key constraints are enforced)

## User Entity (Referenced)

### Fields
- **user_id** (UUID/String, Primary Key)
  - Unique identifier for the user
  - Used as foreign key in Task entity

### Relationship Constraints
- All tasks must belong to an existing user
- If a user is deleted, their tasks should also be deleted (cascade deletion) or the user_id should be preserved but inaccessible
